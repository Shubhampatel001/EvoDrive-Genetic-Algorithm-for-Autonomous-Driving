# EvoDrive - Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous Driving ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

EvoDrive is a project that combines genetic algorithms with advanced simulation techniques to create a pseudo-3D autonomous driving environment. Initially inspired by NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), our project has evolved into a broader implementation of genetic algorithms for self-driving car simulations. This project demonstrates the use of AI to handle tasks such as obstacle avoidance, shortest path navigation, and dynamic world interaction.

## Project Overview

EvoDrive aims to simulate the following features in a dynamic environment:
1. Autonomous driving using genetic algorithms for evolutionary learning.
2. Handling stationary and moving obstacles in a realistic road setup.
3. Building a pseudo-3D environment with interactive elements such as traffic lights and road signs.
4. Dynamic route selection and shortest path computation using algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.
5. Real-time visualization of neural network decisions.
