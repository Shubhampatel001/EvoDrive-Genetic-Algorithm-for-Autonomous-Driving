# EvoDrive - Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous Driving ðŸš—ðŸ’¡

EvoDrive is a project that combines genetic algorithms with advanced simulation techniques to create a pseudo-3D autonomous driving environment. Initially inspired by NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), our project has evolved into a broader implementation of genetic algorithms for self-driving car simulations. This project demonstrates the use of AI to handle tasks such as obstacle avoidance, shortest path navigation, and dynamic world interaction.

## How It Works

### **1. Simulation Environment**
The system creates a virtual road network where vehicles interact. The simulation tests various driving strategies, evaluating them based on predefined metrics like speed, safety, and fuel efficiency.

### **2. Genetic Algorithm for Optimization**
The genetic algorithm is the core mechanism driving strategy evolution.

- **Process**:
  - **Initial Population**: Randomly generated driving strategies are encoded as "chromosomes."
  - **Fitness Evaluation**: Strategies are tested in the simulation and scored based on metrics such as lap time, collision avoidance, and resource efficiency.
  - **Selection**: High-performing strategies are selected to propagate to the next generation.
  - **Crossover and Mutation**:
    - Crossover combines traits of two parent strategies to create offspring.
    - Mutation introduces random changes, ensuring diversity and avoiding local optima.

- **Why GA is Used**:
  GAs are ideal for exploring large, complex search spaces like driving behaviors where the optimal solution isnâ€™t explicitly known.

### **3. Algorithms and Heuristics**

#### **a. Right-Hand Thumb Rule of Traffic**
- Vehicles follow this heuristic to maintain lane discipline and align their trajectories with road geometry.
- This rule ensures realistic driving dynamics, reduces lane violations, and enhances simulation authenticity.

#### **b. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for Pathfinding**
- The road network is represented as a graph with nodes (intersections) and edges (road segments).
- **Function**:
  - Computes the optimal path by minimizing costs like distance or travel time.
  - Ensures vehicles avoid obstacles and reach their destination efficiently.

#### **c. Interpolation for Smooth Path Generation**
- Generates intermediate waypoints between known points to create smooth vehicle trajectories.
- Splines are commonly used to ensure that vehicles follow a continuous and natural curve, avoiding abrupt changes.

#### **d. Envelope Intersection for Collision Detection**
- Vehicles and obstacles are encapsulated in bounding boxes for real-time collision detection.
- Overlapping envelopes trigger evasive actions (e.g., braking, steering adjustments).
- This technique ensures safety in dynamic and crowded environments.

### **4. Simulation Dynamics**
- **Interaction**:
  - Pathfinding (via Dijkstra) provides the initial navigation plan.
  - The genetic algorithm optimizes driving behaviors along the path.
  - Interpolation and collision detection refine movements and ensure safety.

- **Iterative Learning**:
  - Over generations, strategies evolve to meet or exceed performance benchmarks, resulting in efficient and robust autonomous driving solutions.

  - Simulate complex traffic scenarios like intersections, roundabouts, and merging lanes.

- **Integration with Realistic Simulation Platforms**:
  - visit CARLA and Unity platforms for more realistic environment simulations.
  - Use Unityâ€™s extensive library to create advanced object detection, traffic scenarios, and physics-based simulations.

- **Game Mode**:
  - Introduce a "Game Mode" where players can challenge the AI or design obstacles to test its capabilities.
